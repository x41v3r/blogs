# 1 HTML

## 1.1 Getting started with HTML

&emsp;&emsp;HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content.

## 1.2 What's in the head? Metadata in HTML

&emsp;&emsp;The HTML head is the contents of the `<head>` element.

```html
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />  <!-- specify the document's character encoding -->
    <meta name="author" content="Chris Mills" />  <!-- add an author  -->
    <meta name="description" content="The MDN Web Docs Learning Area aims to provide complete beginners to the Web with all they need to know to g    et started with developing websites and applications." />  <!-- add a description -->                                                              16
    <title>My test page</title>  <!-- add a title -->
</head>
```

Notes:

* `utf-8` is a universal character set that includes pretty much any character from any human language. (This means that the web page will be able     to handle displaying any language.)

## 1.3 HTML text fundamentals

### 1.3.1 Headings and paragraphs

&emsp;&emsp;In HTML, each paragraph has to be wrapped in a `<p>` element, like so:

```html 
<p>I am a paragraph, oh yes I am.</p>
```

Each heading has to be wrapped in a heading element: 

```html
<h1>I am the title of the story.</h1>
```

> &emsp;&emsp;There are six heading elements: h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6. Each element represents a different level of content in the document; `<h1>` represents the main heading, `<h2>` represents subheadings, `<h3>` represents sub-subheadings, and so on.

### 1.3.2 Lists

&emsp;&emsp;Unordered lists are used to mark up lists of items for which the order of the items doesn't matter.

```html
<ul>
    <li>milk</li>
    <li>eggs</li>
    <li>bread</li>
    <li>hummus</li>
</ul>
```

&emsp;&emsp;Ordered lists are lists in which the order of the items does matter.

```html
<ol>
    <li>milk</li>
    <li>eggs</li>
    <li>bread</li>
    <li>hummus</li>
</ol>
```

### 1.3.3 Emphasis and importance

# 2 CSS

## 2.1 Getting started with CSS

&emsp;&emsp;CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and lay out web pages.

## 2.2 CSS building blocks

### 2.2.1 Type, class, and ID selectors

```html
<body>
    <h1 id="heading" class="highlight">ID selector</h1>
    <p>
        Veggies es bonus vobis, proinde vos postulo essum magis
        <span>kohlrabi welsh onion</span> daikon amaranth tatsoi
        tomatillo melon azuki bean garlic.
    </p>

    <p id="one" class="highlight">
        Gumbo beet greens corn soko <strong>endive</strong> gumbo gourd. Parsley
        shallot courgette tatsoi pea sprouts fava bean collard greens dandelion okra
        wakame tomato. Dandelion cucumber earthnut pea peanut soko zucchini.
    </p>
    <p>
        Turnip greens yarrow ricebean rutabaga <em>endive cauliflower</em> sea lettuce
        kohlrabi amaranth water spinach avocado daikon napa cabbage asparagus winter
        purslane kale. Celery potato scallion desert raisin horseradish spinach
    </p>
</body>
```

#### Type selectors

&emsp;&emsp;A type selector is sometimes referred to as a tag name selector or element selector because it selects an HTML tag/element in the document. Type selectors are **not case-sensitive**.

```css
body {
    font-family: sans-serif;
}

span {
    background-color: yellow;
}

strong {
    color: rebeccapurple;
}

em {
    color: rebeccapurple;
}
```

#### Class selectors

&emsp;&emsp;The case-sensitive class selector starts with a dot `.` character. *It will select everything in the document with that class applied to it*.

```css
.highlight {
    background-color: yellow;
}
```

#### ID selectors

&emsp;&emsp;The case-sensitive ID selector begins with a `#` rather than a dot character, but is used in the same way as a class selector. *It can select an element that has the id set on it*. However, **an ID can be used only once per page, and elements can only have a single id value applied to them**.

```css
#one {
    background-color: yellow;
}

#heading {
    color: rebeccapurple;
}
```

### 2.2.2 Attribute selectors
